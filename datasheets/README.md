=======================

LAR ADC5:   Also called "ADC V", used for 35t

LAR ADC6:   Also called "ADC V-star", same interface as ADC5 so use ADC5 datasheet

LAR ADC7:   Also called "ADC P1", planned for protoDUNE

LARASIC4:   Used for LongBo in 2012

LARASIC5:   Also called "FE 4-star", used for uBoone and 35t

LARASIC6:   Also called "FE P1"

LARASIC7:   Also called "FE P2", planned for protoDUNE
