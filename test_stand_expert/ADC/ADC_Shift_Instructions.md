ADC ASIC Test-stand Cold Test Shifter Instructions
==================================================

1) Make sure dewar is covered and moisture is wiped off the lip

2) Connect DRY basket above covered dewar

3) Chip/testboard preparation instructions:
  - Check the board status on the whiteboard. If testboard has failed more than once,
    move it to the cleaning and recovery area and select a different board.
  - Make sure the chip to be tested hasnt failed previously. Check
    the Google docs. Any chip that failed twice should be moved
    to the bad ADC holder.
  - Insert NEW chip into the clamshell. Use magnifying glass to verify proper alignment of pins.
  - Close clamshell and cable the board if it is not cabled up.
  - Place board in the basket. Connect cables to DAQ making sure cables are dressed properly and there is enough slack.

4) Start up a fresh FE ADC Tests GUI - BUT DO NOT RUN YET

5) Open a new terminal window and setup the ADC and sync by typing

   femb_adc_setup_board
 

   You will see

   FEMB_CONFIG--> Config ADC ASIC SPI
   FEMB_CONFIG--> Program ADC ASIC SPI
   FEMB_CONFIG--> Check ADC ASIC SPI
   FEMB_CONFIG--> ADC ASIC SPI is OK
   FEMB_CONFIG--> Reset FEMB is DONE
   FEMB_CONFIG--> Start sync ADC
   FEMB_CONFIG--> Test ADC 0
   Starting testUnsync adc:  0
   FEMB_CONFIG--> ADC not synced, try to fix
   try shift: 0 phase: 0 testingUnsync

   ...
 
   FEMB_CONFIG--> ADC synchronized
   FEMB_CONFIG--> Latch latency 0x00000006 0x00000000 Phase: 0xfffc0000
   FEMB_CONFIG--> End sync ADC
   Successfully setup board.
 

   If the sync fails or if a chip takes too many tries (> 3) to sync, try reseating
   the mezannine board on the test board. Power cycle and rerun the script several times until
   the chip sync immediately.

6) Now open the FEMB GUI to see what the ADC is reading back by typing

   femb_gui

7) Adjust the waveform generator to generate a sine wave with a frequency between 1 and 10kHz:

     -On the RIGOL wave function generator click on the burst button once to take local control

     -Make sure SINE, CH1 and OUTPUT1 are all clicked on.

     -Adjust Sine wave parameters till you see the waveform output from the chip clearly.

     [insert instructions for the Keysight generator here]

8) Leave chip ON and and reading out and now start lowering it into the dewar slowly, watch the waveform on the GUI and
   make sure it is stable or reverts to stability after each step lowering it into the dewar. Dunking instructions:

     -Lower the basket until the LN just touches the bottom of the basket. Leave it there until boiling subsides
     -Lower the basket until LN is just above the white chip power connector - check current draw and leave for 5 minutes
     -Lower until LN is just below the clamshell - leave for 5 minutes
     -Lower in 1/4" increments (use meter stick) waiting 3-5 minutes between increments or until waveform on GUI stabilizes  
      whichever is longer
     -Once LN completely covers clamshell, secure the basket rope.

9) If 8) fails and you lose the readback from the chip while immersing in the cold. Close the waveform GUI 
   and try step 5) and 6) and see if it recovers.

   Make sure waveform generator is correctly configured. Check the current draw to make sure a cable hasnt failed.

10) If all goes well and chip is fully immersed and reading out correctly, stop the femb_gui and make
    sure it exits and releases control of the FEMB.

11) start running the FE ADC Test GUI you opened in step 4.

12) Remember to record the run number, board number and chip number in the Google docs. Start a new basket label
    with board and chip number.

13) If the run completes successfully, mark a Y in the appropriate column on Google docs.
    If run fails, note the failure error in the Google doc and make sure to indicate
    on the white board that the testboard failed in the cold. Test boards that fail more
    than once should be returned to Guang/Feng for cleaning.

14) Remove the basket quickly, cover with plastic bag using clothes pegs to close the bag and tag and put it under the table.
    Dress the cables and tie them off with the velcro.
    REMEMBER TO INDICATE TEST STATUS ON THE TAG!
